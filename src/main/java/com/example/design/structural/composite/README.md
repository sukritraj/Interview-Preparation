The Composite Pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures representing part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat individual objects and groups of objects the same way

# relationships. The pattern is used when you want to represent a hierarchy of objects and treat them uniformly.
# 
# The Composite Pattern is part of the structural design patterns in software engineering. It allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
# 
# ## Use Cases
# 
# 1. **File System**: In a file system, files and directories can be treated uniformly. A directory can contain files or other directories, allowing for a hierarchical structure.
# 2. **Graphic Systems**: In graphic systems, shapes can be composed into complex shapes. Each shape can be treated uniformly, allowing for easy manipulation and rendering.
# 3. **UI Components**: In user interface design, components can be composed into complex layouts. Each component can be treated uniformly, allowing for easy management and rendering.
