The Low-Level Design (LLD) of a Parking Lot System involves designing the core classes, relationships, and behaviors required to implement a parking lot. Below is a structured approach to the LLD:

Requirements:
Functional Requirements:
1. Vehicles can enter and exit the parking lot.
2. The system should allocate a parking spot based on the vehicle type (bike, car, truck).
3. Payment calculation based on the parking duration.
4. Support for different parking fees for different vehicle types.
5. Display availability of parking spots.
6. Option for reserved parking spots (e.g., handicapped spaces).

Non-functional Requirements:
1. Scalability for larger parking lots.
2. Performance should be optimal, even under high usage.
3. Fault tolerance to handle failures gracefully.

Class Diagram Overview
1. The parking lot system can be broken into the following entities:
2. ParkingLot: Manages the parking facility.
3. ParkingSpot: Represents individual parking spots.
4. Vehicle: Represents the parked vehicles.
5. ParkingTicket: Keeps track of parking duration and fee.
6. Payment: Handles payment processes.
7. Entrance/Exit Gate: Manages vehicle entry and exit.
8. ParkingFeeCalculator: Calculates the fee based on time and vehicle type.
